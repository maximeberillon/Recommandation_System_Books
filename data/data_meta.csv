"['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Classics']","[""Grade 6 Up-Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson remains one of the classic coming-of-age stories for children and young adults today. After the death of his father, David Balfour sets out to meet his uncle and claim his inheritance. This adventure takes him through the highlands of Scotland where he embarks upon a long journey back from treachery and deceit. The reading by David Rintoul, whose voice is easily recognizable from his roles in several PBS productions such as Pride and Prejudice, translates the written word into an auditory landscape of Scotland. He interprets each character using several voices. As the story progresses, listeners can hear David changing from an uncertain and hesitant youth, to the assured and forthright young man he becomes at the conclusion. Without any special effects, the fight among the crew of the Coventry in the RoundhouseAchairs pushed over, the sounds of the sea hitting against the great shipAbecomes easily visualized. the reader's skill setting the stage and showing the growth of the character is phenomenal. While this is an abridgement, the story flows easily and gives a full picture from beginning to end. This audiobook is a wonderful way to introduce this style of literature to young readers who may feel inhibited by reading the language of Stevenson. Whether read for enjoyment or to enrich the learning experience, this is a must for every serious library collection of the classics.<BR><I>Tina Hudak, Takoma Park Maryland Library, MD </I><BR>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc."", ""From beginning to end, reader David Rintoul, who portrays David Balfor, carries the listener along with his lyrical Scottish accent and suspenseful schemes involving Uncle Ebenezer. The listener submerges himself in the intense plot as Balfor attempts to reclaim his stolen inheritance from his uncle. Rintoul's accent accommodates both Highlanders and Lowlanders, bringing each to life as the author intended. Well-balanced dialogue and narration, along with intelligible accents, lend authenticity to this story. A refreshing listen for any who like to revisit the classics or who have difficulty with the original language.

"['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Poetry']","['Grade 7 Up-Scottish actor John Cairney gives voice to 20 of the poet\'s works, some standards and others slightly more obscure. Cairney portrayed Burns in a solo stage show from 1965 to 1981. He not only performs on this cassette, but also selected and arranged the poems and musical elements. Lilting tunes often introduce a piece, and the familiar melody of ""Auld Lang Syne"" plays throughout that reading. ""Tam o\'Shanter,"" ""To a Mouse,"" ""To a Louse,"" and ""A Red, Red Rose"" are here, as well as the less well known ""Mary Morison,"" ""Of a\' the Airts,"" and ""The Banks of Doon."" Language arts instructors who teach Burns and want to convey a sense of what he intended will especially appreciate this collection and Cairney\'s performance. The dramatic and occasional special effects will help to capture students\' imaginations. The romantic pieces provide a leisurely pace for neophytes to familiarize themselves with the accent.<BR><I>Diana Dickerson, White Pigeon Community Schools, MI </I><BR>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.', 'Despite the package\'s claims that this is the perfect introduction to Burns\'s work, listeners might well find themselves playing the tape twice, once for the music, the second time to try to pick out the words. Ideally, they would hear the tape while looking at the poems on the page, but the producer did not choose to include the text. Actor John Cairney, who has been performing Burns\'s poems since 1959, does a more than credible reading, but unfortunately being enthusiastic about the recording and true to the 18th-century Scottish dialect does little to enhance the American listener\'s appreciation. The 20 poems presented here include longer works, such as ""The Cotter\'s Saturday Night"" and ""Tam O\'Shanter,"" along with ""Holy Willie\'s Prayer,"" ""Epistle to a Young Friend,"" ""A Red, Red Rose,"" and ""Auld Lang Syne."" With longer poems, it\'s difficult to tell when the selection ends, while shorter poems run into one another. This is currently the only tape of Burns\'s work available, so interested fans will have to make do.

AFRICAN GENESIS (1961) introduced his new evolutionary approach to an understanding of men. Then came THE TERRITORIAL IMPERATIVE (1966), whose title is now a common phrase in our language. THE SOCIAL CONTRACT is the third in the series, and it denies that men are created equal. Robert Ardrey maintains that since the publication of Rousseaus Contrat social two centuries ago, mean have wasted social resources, converted much of education into a process of brain-washing, committed themselves to one political insane asylum after another, all in pursuit of a goal that is a natural impossibility in any sexually reproducing species. He even denies that his thesis is controversial, since he is merely presenting a body of scientific proof for what we should all know anyway. Discarding the myth, Robert Ardrey combines his wealth of knowledge of animal ways with the new insights of modern biology and the newest revelations concerning human evolution to probe perplexing contemporary problems: the revolt of the young, the status struggle and the role of leadership, population control, urban overcrowding, and violence in civilized life. This brilliant book offers a powerful challenge to accustomed thought. This trilogy of books were instrumental in changing scientific doctrine and increasing public awareness of evolutionary science. Ardreys work was so popular that many prominent scientists cite it as inspiring them to enter their fields.']",Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder,Visit Amazon's Robert Ardrey Page,"1,698,882 in Books (",$47.29,0002117908

On 14 August 1947 one-fifth of humanity claimed their independence from the greatest empire history has ever seen. But 400 million people were to find that the immediate price of freedom was partition and war, riot and murder. In this superb reconstruction, Collins and Lapierre recount the eclipse of the fabled British Raj and examine the roles enacted by, among others, Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Mountbatten in its violent transformation into the new India and Pakistan. This is the India of Jawaharlal Nehru, heart-broken by the tragedy of the country's division; of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, a Moslem who drank, ate pork and rarely entered a mosque, yet led 45 million Moselms to nationhood; of Gandhi, who stirred a subcontinent without raising his voice; of the last viceroy, Mountbatten, beseeched by the leaders of an independent India to take back the powers he'd just passed to them.""]",Freedom at midnight,Visit Amazon's Larry Collins Page,"646,618 in Books (",$20.38,0002160552

Lewis - one of the greatest writers of the 20th century - whose books for children and adults have become much-loved classics. Part of the story of C.S. Lewis has been made famous through the film ""Shadowlands"". Here this fascinating man\'s entire life-story is told by those who knew him personally. C.S. Lewis was born in Belfast in 1898 and was sent to England for a public school education with his elder brother, Warren. Lewis exhibited a genius for imagination and perception from his earliest years. Brought up in a Christian household, Lewis lost his faith in his teenage years but was to regain it, with reluctance, as a fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford. His faith subsequently influenced his writings. He became a vigorous champion of the Christian faith through classics such as ""Mere Christianity"" and through his BBC broadcasts. His ""Chronicles of Narnia"" became children\'s classics and he was deluged with correspondence from his young readers. In his latter years he unexpectedly fell deeply in love with a divorced American, Joy Greshem, and married her, only to suffer the devastation of her death a few years later. C.S. Lewis died in 1963 at his home in Oxford. During his lifetime C.S. Lewis suggested to his friend, Roger Lancelyn Green, who was a fellow English scholar, that he would undertake his biography one day. After Lewis\'s death in 1963 Lancelyn Green and Walter Hooper were approached by several of Lewis\'s friends, to write the biography. Warren Lewis, brother to Jack, contributed a great deal to the writing. The authors had at their disposal a vast collection of letters and diaries, as well as the recollections of many surviving family members and friends. Walter Hooper has enhanced the original text with additional material to provide a new, expanded edition.']",Biography of C.S.

But alongside the triumphant moments came the inevitable darker side - the drugs, the alcohol and the women. The book reveals the truth about his playboy image, and explains Hunt's successful transition from hero of the track and social celebrity to articulate BBC television commentator, breeder of budgies and energetic cyclist.

Their MOs provide plenty of fodder for an author trying to cook up a work of psychological terror: Both are powerful, handsome, brilliant (natch), commit perfect crimes, and, despite their busy schedules, manage to keep in touch with each other. To catch them, you obviously need a perfect crime fighter. Enter Alex Cross, the Washington, D.C., detective/psychologist hero of bestselling Along Came A Spider (1993), who gets dragged into all this after his niece Naomi, a student at Duke University, vanishes. Working with the authorities and a medical student named Kate McTiernan, who was lucky enough to escape Casanova's clutches, Cross begins to understand how the two dueling psychos operate. Just in the nick of time, too, because the Gentleman Caller, on the run from the law out West, decides that nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina with his old buddy Casanova. So, what does Cross, whose favorite niece is now in the clutches of two sickos, do? Fall in love with Kate McTiernan, of course, in an ill-placed romantic subplot intended to raise the stakes in the deadly cat-and-mouse game. Does Cross save Naomi? Are the two killers brought to justice or, at the very least, consigned to gory demises? Who cares? As a storyteller, Patterson is a great ad copywriter.

From the endlessly inventive mind of one of fantasy's all time greats, comes a spellbinding new adventure of high magic, treachery and bloody war. This time in conjunction with master of alternative US history, Steve Stirling, Feist returns to tell the full tale of one of his fans' favourite most colourful Riftwar characters, pickpocket, montebank and confidence trickster Jimmy the Hand. Jimmy the Hand, boy thief of Krondor, lived in the shadows of the city. The sewers were his byways and a flea-ridden, rat infested cellar his home. Gifted beyond his peers, he was still but a nimble street urchin, a pickpocket with potential. Until the day he met Prince Arutha. Aiding the Prince in his rescue of Princess Anita from imprisonment by Duke Guy du Bas-Tyra, Jimmy ran afoul of Black Guy's secret police. Fearing reprisal and seeking an opportunity to advance his place in life, Jimmy fled the city and ventured north to the relatively safe haven of Sarth. Suspecting the rural villagers had never encountered a lad with his talent and nose for finding wealth -- other people's wealth, Jimmy was unprepared for what greeted him. For Sarth was home to others who trod the dodgy path, and more, to a darker secret, a dangerous presence unknown to even the local thieves and smugglers.

Sharpe, the rest of his battalion and rising star of the general staff Arthur Wellesley, are about to embark upon the siege of the island citadel of the Tippoo of Mysore, Seringapatam. The British must remove this potentate from his Tiger Throne, but he has gone to great lengths to defend his city from attack. When a senior British officer is captured by the Tippoo's forces, Sharpe is offered a chance to attempt a rescue and infiltrate the Tippoo's forces. Sharpe needs no invitation to get away from the tyrannical Sergeant Hakeswill, but once inside the dangerous world of the Tippoo he realises he will need all his wits just to stay alive, let alone save the British army from catastrophe.

Here, Patterson brings back the black psychiatrist and Washington, D.C., homicide cop (Kiss the Girls, etc.) for a gripping game of death that will have fans flocking. Two simultaneous investigations bear down on Cross: the first concerns the killings perpetrated by a duo known as ""Jack and Jill,"" who are murdering famous people (beginning with a U.S. senator) in Washington, taunting the police and ""practicing for the big one""; the second involves the brutal slayings of young black children in Cross\'s own Southeast D.C. neighborhood. The Washington P.D. makes Cross its liaison with a frantic Secret Service, FBI and CIA while he sets up his own off-duty team to track the child-killer. Through crisp cross-cutting of multiple points of view, first-person and third, Patterson grabs readers right from the beginning and sweeps them along toward riveting dual climaxes. He adds texture by devoting space to Cross\'s concern about his own motherless son and daughter (the first murdered child attended the same grammar school as Alex\'s boy), his growing interest in the school\'s attractive principal, his dealings with his octogenarian grandmother, Nana Mama (think of an acerbic Dilsey from The Sound and the Fury) and life in the largely black Southeast district.

As ever, the story starts fast, here with the murder of an English army officer in London by Captain John Lavisser a traitor working for the French and as vile a villain as any Sharpe has faced and scarcely lets up until Sharpe's final confrontation with Lavisser during the British bombardment of Copenhagen. Along with the swashbuckling action, Sharpe finds romance with the widowed daughter of Britain's top Danish agent, Astrid Skovgaard, who helps him get over the loss of Grace, the aristocratic young woman he met in his last outing, Sharpe's Trafalgar, but who died in childbirth. Much of the suspense hinges on whether Sharpe will quit the army and remain in Denmark, or persuade Astrid to return with him to England. Unlike Patrick O'Brian, Cornwell doesn't dwell on the details of early 19th-century life, writing in plain prose that neither evokes nor obviously violates period. This is the 18th installment in the Sharpe series (which now covers the years from 1799 to 1821, with a few small gaps).

Though Sharpe usually spends his days foiling enemies on gritty battlefields, this time around he is assigned to a delicate diplomatic mission. After returning from a successful tour of duty in India, Richard has a difficult time readjusting to the petty distinctions and distractions of His Majesty's army in Britain. Humiliated by his relegation to the post of quartermaster and desolated by the death of his beloved Grace, an embittered Richard contemplates resigning his recently acquired commission. Persuaded by a wily old general to serve as bodyguard to Captain John Lavisser, aide to the duke of York, on a top-secret expedition to Denmark, he welcomes the change of scenery and relishes the opportunity to flex his considerable muscles. When Lavisser is exposed as a double agent determined to secure the Danish fleet for France, Richard must rely on his native intelligence and his formidable combat skills to stay alive in an elaborately crafted game of cat-and-mouse. The undisputed master of the military adventure, Cornwell delivers another suspenseful, historically accurate episode in the chronicles of a resourceful Napoleonic-era soldier. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association.

By the time the police admit that Bradfield, a fictional city in northern England, has a serial killer, four men are already dead, each tortured in a different way and then abandoned outdoors in town. Baffled by a lack of physical evidence left by the meticulous sociopath, police bring in Tony Hill, a Home Office forensic psychologist who profiles criminals. Tony, who begins each day by ""selecting a persona,"" devours crime data with a fascination approaching admiration for the killer. The interest distracts him from obsessing over his own sexual impotence and over the ""exquisite torture"" of salacious phone calls he\'s been getting from a strange woman. DI Carol Jordan, a mercifully normal person who is Tony\'s liaison with the force, quickly grasps the profiling approach while keeping her policing instincts. Carol and Tony forge an uneasy relationship; but, as they pursue ""the Queer Killer,"" a cloddish policeman undermines them, a local reporter blows the case to get a byline and the murderer closes in on a new quarry. A warning: woven into this powerful story are journal entries in which the murder discusses torture in loving detail, an aspect that makes this graphic, psychologically terrifying tale almost as off-putting as it is impossible to put down.

Anne, her sister Mary and their brother George are all brought to the king\'s court at a young age, as players in their uncle\'s plans to advance the family\'s fortunes. Mary, the sweet, blond sister, wins King Henry VIII\'s favor when she is barely 14 and already married to one of his courtiers. Their affair lasts several years, and she gives Henry a daughter and a son. But her dark, clever, scheming sister, Anne, insinuates herself into Henry\'s graces, styling herself as his adviser and confidant. Soon she displaces Mary as his lover and begins her machinations to rid him of his wife, Katherine of Aragon. This is only the beginning of the intrigue that Gregory so handily chronicles, capturing beautifully the mingled hate and nearly incestuous love Anne, Mary and George (""kin and enemies all at once"") feel for each other and the toll their family\'s ambition takes on them. Mary, the story\'s narrator, is the most sympathetic of the siblings, but even she is twisted by the demands of power and status; charming George, an able plotter, finally brings disaster on his own head by falling in love with a male courtier. Anne, most tormented of all, is ruthless in her drive to become queen, and then to give Henry a male heir. Rather than settling for a picturesque rendering of court life, Gregory conveys its claustrophobic, all-consuming nature with consummate skill. In the end, Anne\'s famous, tragic end is offset by Mary\'s happier fate, but the self-defeating folly of the quest for power lingers longest in the reader\'s mind.<BR>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.', 'Before Henry VIII ever considered making Anne Boleyn his wife, her older sister, Mary, was his mistress. Historical novelist Gregory (Virgin Earth) uses the perspective of this ""other Boleyn girl"" to reveal the rivalries and intrigues swirling through England. The sisters and their brother George were raised with one goal: to advance the Howard family\'s interests, especially against the Seymours. So when Mary catches the king\'s fancy, her family orders her to abandon the husband they had chosen. She bears Henry two children, including a son, but Anne\'s desire to be queen drives her with ruthless intensity, alienating family and foes. As Henry grows more desperate for a legitimate son and Anne strives to replace Catherine as queen, the social fabric weakens. Mary abandons court life to live with a new husband and her children in the countryside, but love and duty bring her back to Anne time and again. We share Mary\'s helplessness as Anne loses favor, and everyone abandons her amid accusations of adultery, incest, and witchcraft. Even the Boleyn parents won\'t intervene for their children. Gregory captures not only the dalliances of court but the panorama of political and religious clashes throughout Europe.

"['Books', 'History', 'Europe']","['Continuing and concluding ""The Russian Revolution"", and completing the trilogy begun with ""Russia under the Old Regime"", this book however, stand on its own. It deals with the attempts of the Bolsheviks to defend and expand their authority from the Great Russian base which they had conquered in the winter of 1917-18 to the borderlands of the defunct Russian Empire and beyond, to the rest of the world. By the autumn of 1920 it became apparent that these efforts would not succeed, and that the new regime had to concentrate on building a communist state at home. The closing part of the book deal with the crises this unexpected development caused Russia\'s new rulers. In addition, the author discusses Communist cultural and religious policies. By treating these and other topics usually ignored by historians, the author seeks to fulfill the promise given in the introduction to ""The Russian Revolution"" to look beyond the struggle for power which is commonly seen as the quintessence of the Revolution, to its makers\' designs and to their uses of that power. The book concludes with the death of Lenin in January 1924, by which time all the institutions and nearly all the practices of the future Stalinism were in place.', '', '']",Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime,Visit Amazon's Richard Pipes Page,"7,722,965 in Books (",$8.85,0002720884

This book contains multiple allusions to past events, yet the first-time reader can still become immediately involved in the narrative, thanks to Plain\'s adroit blending of complex personalities with a panoramic view of world events. The novel covers the early \'20s until the end of World War II. Paterfamilias is Paul Werner, a high-minded banker, a dedicated philanthropist and a reluctant adulterer. His genteel wife Marion, unable to bear children, coolly retreats to her private circle of charitable events and card parties. Although Paul still broods over his first love, Anna, he turns to his exuberant cousin Leah, a flourishing business woman, for a brief, happy affair. It is at a large family gathering that long pent-up emotions explode, and past tragedies, infidelities and hostilities emerge with destructive force. Although there is a historical inevitability to the events viewed here (the 1920 ""Red scare""; Prohibition; the stock market crash; the rise of Hitler) the characters are never predictable.

One of the most potent forces bedevilling the modern world is religious extremism, and the need to understand it has never been greater. Focusing in detail on Protestant fundamentalism in the United States, Jewish fundamentalism from sixteenth century Spain onwards and Muslim fundamentalism over the last four hundred years, Armstrong examines the patterns that underlie fundamentalism. These evolve from the clash between the conservative pre-modern mind that is governed by a love of myth, and the progressive rational society that relishes change. Fundamentalists view the contemporary world with horror, rejecting its claims to truth, and a state of war now exists over the future of our culture. They are not terrorists, rather, they are innovative, existing in a symbiotic relationship with an aggressive modernity, each urging the other on to greater excess. The Battle for God is original in its thesis and in its understanding; as a history of religious ideas it is fascinating, and as an explanation of one of the most destabilizing forces at large in the world today it is extraordinary.""]","The Battle for God : Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam",Visit Amazon's Karen Armstrong Page,"1,839,365 in Books (",$11.96,0006383483

The second Riftwar collaboration, Murder in LaMut, written by masters of fantasy Raymond E. Feist and Joel Rosenburg. The heavy action was supposedly at Crydee these days which meant that the one place they could be sure the three of them were not going was Crydee. Come spring, the privateer Melanie was due in Ylith, and its captain could be counted on for a swift conveyance away for sure, and likely not to murder them in their sleep. That would be bad for business. But away where? That wasn't Durine's worry. Kethol would surely be able to find the three of them somebody who needed men who knew which part of the sword you used to cut with and which part you used to butter your bread, and Pirojil would be able to negotiate a price at least half again what the employer was ready to pay. All Durine would have to do was kill people. That was fine with him. Durine, Kethol and Pirojil are three mercenaries who have spent twenty years fighting other people's battles: against the Tsurani and the Bugs and the goblins, and now it seems they've run out of Tsurani, Bugs and goblins to kill. The prospect of a few months of garrison duty offers a welcome respite; but then they are given an assignment that seems, on the surface, like cushy work -- to protect a lady and her husband and deliver them safely to the city of Lamut. It should all have been so simple! Raymond E. Feist is the author of the bestselling and critically acclaimed Riftwar Saga, the Serpentwar Saga and the epic Krondor series.

He claims to be a meteorologist and enlists local men to help him build a ""rainmill"" that will bring an end to the crippling drought. Only Matthew\'s brother Robert, 11, who has visions of his dead Uncle Edmund trying to warn him of something, and bookish Uncle Alden remain skeptical and apart. In time, memories of Matthew fade; then other children disappear. Only Robert really remembers his brother and alone he pieces together what has become of the missing children. Suspense builds to a searing and satisfying climax involving malevolent ""traders"" from the stars. As odd as this may sound, it is a logical conclusion to a story filled with mystery. The plot is strewn with foreshadowing, portents of evil, and foreboding.

Most of the story takes place in a Brooklyn neighborhood resembling Borough Park, although, as in her previous books, dramatic fanfare occurs in Israel, too. Pious Tamar both adores and is in awe of her warm and brilliant husband, Josh. She is looking forward to an intimate evening after her ritual visit to the mikvah (here Ragen offers a tediously detailed description about Jewish conjugal laws), but that evening she is raped by a black man. She does not tell her husband about the attack, and when she discovers she is pregnant, she does not abort the fetus, because she is not sure whether the rapist or Josh is the father. In trying to make the reader understand why Tamar would choose silence and sustain the pregnancy, Ragen flashes back to Tamar's youth, particularly her relationship with two friends who play pivotal roles throughout her life: Hadassah, the beautiful, rebellious daughter of the neighborhood's primary religious leader, and Jenny, who comes from a secular background but easily adapts to Orthodox observance. The interplay between the girls as they take tentative steps into the secular world of the late 1960s provides some charming scenes, and the final chapters prove moving and dramatic when later consequences of Tamar's deceptive silence shatter her family's life. While Ragen is an able storyteller and handles dialogue deftly, her plots are becoming hackneyed. It's an insular and provincial world that she has chosen to portray, and here she adds little that is new or eye-opening to the reader. <BR>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."", 'Ragen (Jepthe\'s Daughter, LJ 12/88) continues to describe life in the ultra-orthodox Jewish communities of the United States and Israel.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the ninth book in the series. Uniquely among authors of naval fiction, Patrick O'Brian allows his characters to develop with experience. The Jack Aubrey of Treason's Harbour has a record of successes equal to that of the most brilliant of Nelson's band of brothers, and he is no less formidable or decisive in action or strategy. But he is wiser, kinder, gentler too. Much of the plot of Treason's Harbour depends on intelligence and counter-intelligence, a field in which Aubrey's friend Stephen Maturin excels. Through him we get a clearer insight into the life and habits of the sea officers of Nelson's time than we would ever obtain seeing things through their own eyes. There is plenty of action and excitement in this novel, but it is the atmosphere of a Malta crowded with senior officers waiting for news of what the French are up to, and wondering whether the war will end before their turn comes for prize money and for fame, that is here so freshly and vividly conveyed.""]",Treason's Harbour,Visit Amazon's Patrick O'Brian Page,"6,389,113 in Books (",$15.08,0006499236

Life has not proved easy for single mom Dianne Robbins, of Gull Point, Conn. Abandoned by her husband, lobsterman Tim McIntosh, just before their daughter Julia was born with spina bifida and Rett syndrome--a debilitating physical condition and an autism-like disorder, respectively--Dianne supports herself and Julia by building children's playhouses. At the age of 11, Julia weighs 29 pounds, and there is no guarantee she will live much longer; yet she has a magical radiance. Despite the difficulties of caring for a severely disabled child, Dianne is never bitter, and her relationship with Julia is hope filled and loving. Dianne had also believed that her strong love would repair Tim's damaged self-esteem and save their marriage. Now she is wary of getting involved with a man again. But Tim's brother, Alan, who also happens to be Julia's pediatrician, has been secretly in love with Dianne for years, and his steadfast devotion may be just what she needs. Meanwhile, Amy Brook, an adorable 12-year-old from a troubled family (and a familiar device in Rice's novels), finds sanctuary in the Robbins household and becomes Julia's best friend; through Amy's example, Dianne finally understands what true love means. The author takes an unaccustomed shortcut when she reveals the plot's conclusion through heretofore silent Julia's thoughts.

"['Books', 'History', 'Ancient Civilizations']","['A vivid and superbly written account of the unravelling of one of the great intellectual puzzles, set against the backdop of Europe in the Napoleonic era. When Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, his troops were astonished to discover ancient temples, tombs and statues, all covered with hieroglyphs -- the last remnants of an unreadable script and a language lost in time. On their return Egyptomania spread rapidly and the quest to decipher hieroglyphs began in earnest. Jean-Francois Champollion was obsessed with ancient languages from a very young age, and once he heard of the unreadable ancient Egyptian text he had found the challenge to which he would dedicate his life: the decipherment of hieroglyphs. Despite poverty he made gradual progress, although he had to fight against jealous enemies, both professional and political, every step of the way -- a dangerous task when in post-Revolutionary France a slip of the tongue could mean ruin, exile or even death. Failure threatened, as he was only one of many attempting to read the hieroglyphs, and his main rival, the English Thomas Young, claimed that decipherment was imminent, but Champollion refused to be distracted and finally, in 1822, he made the decisive breakthrough: he was the first person able to read the ancient Egyptian language in well over a thousand years.']",The Keys of Egypt : The Race to Read the Hieroglyphs,Visit Amazon's Lesley Adkins Page,"2,763,648 in Books (",,0006531458

In this unauthorized, carefully researched biography, Baxter traces the enigmatic actors life, starting with his formative years in Greenwich Village, where De Niro tagged along with Italian street gangs and had a complicated relationship with his gay artist father, a fact that Baxter suggests has greatly informed the actors choice of morally conflicted characters. Using numerous interviews and anecdotes, Baxter sketches a picture that is never quite flattering, but is empathetic and fascinating. He tells De Niros story through the prism of the actors most notable cinematic endeavors (including Taxi Driver and Raging Bull) as well as through his biggest failures. As a result, the book is equal parts life story and film analysis. This works to great effect, since De Niros artistic choices, many of which involved physical transformations and psychological sparring with his fellow actors, reveal as much, if not more, about his own character as any exposition on the actors life experience. As Baxter portrays him, De Niro appears more comfortable being anyone other than himself. His total immersion into characters such as Travis Bickle spooked his co-stars but won him great acclaim, despite what the author describes as a career decline that began with The King of Comedy. In subsequent years, Baxter notes, De Niro has rested on his reputation, choosing mediocre but commercially viable projects that would, in turn, fund his entrepreneurial pursuits in his beloved lower Manhattan neighborhood. De Niro remains one of cinemas most enduring presences, a human puzzle, perhaps even unto himself. 40 b/w photos.<br />Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The world of 14th-century America is unknown to most readers and Penina Spinka's remarkable novel brings it triumphantly alive, from the tribal wars through to the Norse invasions and the fiercely resisted Christianity. The girl known as Picture Maker because of her great ability at drawing and prophecy, is the daughter of one of the warriors and the granddaughter of the clan leader. She is captured by one of her family's enemies and because she was regarded as a trophy is kept alive and enslaved. When she discovers she is pregnant by one of her captors, she manages to escape, and, inspired by the destiny she had depicted, begins the long, mysterious journey which ends in the furthermost parts of the Western Hemisphere. There, still an outsider but revered and protected, she lives for a time in peace with an Inuit tribe until she meets and falls in love with Halvard, a Norse hunter, who seems to hold the key to the riddle of her birth. Together they travel on to Greenland but Picture Maker's special gifts make her regarded with suspicion, Halvard is attacked and her daughter will be taken from her, in what seems a terrible repetition of what happened to her so long ago. Picture Maker is a powerful story, with a large cast of vivid characters, in a fascinating setting which will appeal to readers of Jean Auel and Jane Smiley. Penina Spinka, an award-winner for her children's books, has created a rich picture of the period and the people, of the ways of the societies and religions, and above all of Picture Maker herself, as she grows beyond her once narrow, ordered confines: an amazing and very human survivor.

But before he can discover the missing girl, the French onslaught on Portugal begins and the city of Oporto falls. Sharpe is stranded behind enemy lines, but he has Patrick Harper, he has his riflemen and he has the assistance of a young, idealistic Portuguese officer. Together, they have to find the missing girl and extricate themselves from the entanglements cast by Colonel Christopher, a mysterious Englishman who has his own ideas on how the French can be ejected from Portugal. Those ideas are as fantastic as they are dangerous, but the French are rampant, Lisbon is threatened and Christopher sees Sharpe and his riflemen as the only obstacles to his subtle scheme. But there is a newly arrived British commander in Lisbon, Sir Arthur Wellesley, and just when Sharpe and his men seem doomed, Sir Arthur mounts his own counter-attack, an operation that will send the French army reeling back into the northern mountains.

Situated on the Aegean where two mountain ranges meet, Salonica has a unique geographical location, which promoted the rich confluence of cultures that once characterized the city. Part travelogue, part history and part cultural study, this is a splendid tour of the fortunes and misfortunes of this Balkan city. Drawing on a wealth of archival documents, Mazower (<I>The Balkans</I>; <I>Dark Continent</I>) weaves a lavish tapestry illustrating the tangled history of Salonica, which began as a Hellenistic urban center in 315 B.C. and flourished through the Middle Ages as a Greek Orthodox city. In 1430, the Ottoman Empire commenced a rule that lasted until 1912. By the end of the 15th century, Salonica had a large influx of Jews who had fled persecution in Spain. Mazower eloquently points out that these ""peoples of the Book"" largely tolerated and learned from one another, even though rivalry sometimes erupted into street fights, civil wars and power struggles. A series of civil wars in the 19th century returned the city to the Greeks, and the fall of the Ottoman Empire after WWI turned Salonica into a European city. In addition, the impact of the work of 19th-century Christian missionaries, along with the Nazis\' removal of Jews, left Salonica bereft of its rich religious pluralism and multiethnic heritage. Mazower\'s graceful, evocative prose, his deft attention to details and his empathetic presentation of all sides of the story add up to a magnificent tale of this unique city. 32 pages of illus., eight in color; 10 maps. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the Hellenistic and Roman eras, the city became a vibrant, cosmopolitan commercial center sitting astride the trade routes to Africa and Asia. Under the Byzantine Empire, the city was a center of humanistic learning and theological debate, coming under Ottoman control in 1430. Mazower's illuminating and surprising account focuses on the city from the commencement of Ottoman rule to the Nazi occupation. Despite the claims of Greek nationalists, Ottoman rule was relatively benign, as Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived, worked, and often prospered together. When the city reverted to Greek control in 1912, the consensus started to dissolve. Muslims left or were expelled, and resentment against Jews increased. Under the Nazis, Jews, perhaps, 20 percent of the population, were deported en masse to concentration camps.

Light and though, spiritual energy, vibrates very quickly. Physical energy, and problem areas, vibrate more slowly. When the highest/fastest frequencies of spirit are brought to the presence of lower/slower frequencies, they nullify and dissipate those things we call problems. We all have the ability to increase our energy and access the highest/fastest energies to eradicate problems in our lives. In carefully structured chapters, Wayne Dyer draws on both ancient wisdom and firsthand accounts, and shows how to: stop giving energy to things you don\'t believe in / keep your energy field uncontaminated / raise and maintain your spiritual energy. In the second part of the book, ""Putting spiritual problem solving into action"", Dyer shows how we can transform any negative energy into positive energy: hate into love / hurt into forgiveness / doubt into faith / despair into hope / sadness into joy']",There Is a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem,Visit Amazon's Wayne W.

The book begins with the remarkable story of India\'s rise from commercial enclave to great Empire, from Clive\'s victory of Plassey, through the imperial wars of the eighteenth century and the Afghan and Sikh Wars of the 1840s, through the bloody turmoil of the Mutiny, and the frontier campaigns at the century\'s end.

Shield\'s explanation for her novel\'s title lends meaning to this multilayered narrative in which a mother\'s grief over a daughter\'s break with the family revises her feminist outlook and pushes her craft as a writer in a new direction.', 'The oldest daughter of 44-year-old Reta Winters suddenly, inexplicably, drops out of college and ends up on a Toronto street corner panhandling, with a cardboard sign around her neck that reads ""goodness."" The quiet comforts of Reta\'s small-town life and the constancy of her feminist perspective sustain her hope that her daughter will snap out of this, whatever ""this"" is. Threaded into her family\'s crisis is her ongoing internal elegy on the exclusion of women from the literary canon, which she transposes to mean her daughter\'s exclusion from humanity. Reta wonders if her daughter has discovered, as she herself did years before, that the world is ""an endless series of obstacles, an alignment of locked doors,"" and has chosen to pursue the one thing that doesn\'t require power or a voice: goodness.', 'In her own writing, Reta reaffirms her own sense of self, as well as her sense of humor. As her theoretical reflections on modern womanhood play counterpoint to her unwavering sense of creating a home and keeping her family together, Reta\'s smarts and fears form a wonderfully coherent narrative--a life worth reading about. With <I>Unless</I>, the inaugural title in HarperCollins\'s Fourth Estate imprint, Shields (author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <I><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/014023313X/${0}"">The Stone Diaries</a></I>) once again asserts her place in the canon. <I>--Emily Russin</I>', ""If I have any reputation at all it is for being an editor and scholar, and not for producing, to everyone's amazement, a fresh, bright, springtime piece of fiction,' or so it was described in Publishers Weekly. That cheeky self-description sums up the protagonist of Shields's latest, the precocious, compassionate and feisty Reta Winters, an accomplished author who suddenly finds her literary success meaningless when the oldest of her three daughters, Norah, drops out of college to live on the streets of Toronto with a placard labeled Goodness hung around her neck. Shields takes an elliptical approach to Winters's dilemma, slowly exploring the possible reasons why a bright, attractive young woman would simply give up and drop out. As Shields makes her way through Winters's literary career, her marriage and the difficulties she and her daughter face in being taken seriously as women in the modern era, she employs an ingenious conceit by tracking Winters's emotions as she tries to write a sequel to her light romantic novel while helping a fellow writer, a Holocaust survivor, work on her memoirs. As Norah's plight deepens and the nature of her decision begins to surface, the romantic novel turns dark and serious, and Winters faces a rewrite when her long-time editor dies and his pedantic successor tries to introduce a sexist plot twist. Reta Winters is a marvelously inventive character whose thought-provoking commentary on the ties between writing, love, art and family are constantly compelling in this unabashedly feminist novel. The icing on the cake is the ending, which introduces a startling but believable twist to the plight of a young woman who, in doing nothing... has claimed everything. The result is a landmark book that constitutes yet another noteworthy addition to Shields's impressive body of work. <BR>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.""]",Unless: A Novel,Visit Amazon's Carol Shields Page,"2,347,137 in Books (",$14.94,0007141076

"['Books', 'History', 'Europe']","[""The Sunday Times bestselling biography of one of the towering figures in British history who became Prime Minister at the age of twenty-four, written by the youngest-ever leader of the Tory Party. The younger William Pitt -- known as the 'schoolboy' -- began his days as Prime Minister in 1783 deeply underestimated and completely beleaguered. Yet he annihilated his opponents in the General Election the following year and dominated the governing of Britain for twenty-two years, nearly nineteen of them as Prime Minister. No British politician since then has exercised such supremacy for so long. Pitt presided over dramatic changes in the country's finances and trade, brought about the union with Ireland, but was ultimately consumed by the years of debilitating war with France.

The Hungry Tide is a rich, exotic saga set in Calcutta and in the vast archipelago of islands in the Bay of Bengal. An Indian myth says that when the river Ganges first descended from the heavens, the force of the cascade was so great that the earth would have been destroyed if it had not been for the god Shiva, who tamed the torrent by catching it in his dreadlocks. It is only when the Ganges approaches the Bay of Bengal that it frees itself and separates into thousands of wandering strands. The result is the Sundarbans, an immense stretch of mangrove forest, a half-drowned land where the waters of the Himalayas merge with the incoming tides of the sea. It is this vast archipelago of islands that provides the setting for Amitav Ghosh's new novel. In the Sundarbans the tides reach more than 100 miles inland and every day thousands of hectares of forest disappear only to re-emerge hours later. Dense as the mangrove forests are, from a human point of view it is only a little less barren than a desert. There is a terrible, vengeful beauty here, a place teeming with crocodiles, snakes, sharks and man-eating tigers. This is the only place on earth where man is more often prey than predator. And it is into this terrain that an eccentric, wealthy Scotsman named Daniel Hamilton tried to create a utopian society, of all races and religions, and conquer the might of the Sundarbans. In January 2001, a small ship arrives to conduct an ecological survey of this vast but little-known environment, and the scientists on board begin to trace the journeys of the descendants of this society.""]",The Hungry Tide,Visit Amazon's Amitav Ghosh Page,"1,734,666 in Books (",$15.28,0007141785

Among the survivors who are rounded up and taken back to Ireland is Succat: an impulsive sixteen-year-old son of a powerful Roman family. Succat is sold as a slave and put to work tending sheep.

The title story, 'The Grandmothers', is an astonishing tour de force, a shockingly intimate portrait of an unconventional extended family and the lengths to which they will go to find happiness and love. Written with a keen cinematic eye, the story is a ruthless dissection of the veneer of middle-class morality and convention which manages to be at once universal and desperately, heartbreakingly personal. A second story, 'Victoria and the Staveneys', takes us through 20 years of the life of a young underprivilged black girl in London. A chance meeting introduces her to the world of the Staveneys -- a liberal white middle-class family -- and, seduced, she falls pregnant by one of the sons. As her young daughter grows up, Victoria feels her parental control diminishing as the attractions of the Staveney's world exert themselves. An honest and often uncomfortable look at race relations in London over the past few decades, Lessing reaffirms her brilliance at demonstrating the effect of society on the individual. With these and two other equally brilliant novellas, Lessing has proven once again that she is one of our most valuable and insightful living authors.""]",The Grandmothers,Visit Amazon's Doris Lessing Page,"1,022,775 in Books (",$14.83,0007152817

The story is narrated by two very different teenagers, who each inhabit two extraordinarily different worlds. Arianrhod Hyde's world (or Roddy, as she prefers to be called) is very much the world of magic, pageantry and ritual. Not unlike Britain in King Arthur's Day, Roddy is daughter of two Court Wizards and therefore part of the King's Progress, travelling round the Islands of Blest and ready to take part in whatever ritual or ceremony is required, as it occurs. Presiding over all, the most important person is the Merlin, who is entrusted with the magical health of the Isles of Blest. Nick Mallory's world is much more familiar -- at least, it starts off being our own. But it soon transpires that Nick's not quite the ordinary 15 year old he seems, as he slips sideways into something he thinks is a dream -- but in fact is another world entirely. Now, Nick's been on other worlds before (although never alone) but he's a confident type. Maybe a bit too confident! In Roddy's world, the current Merlin expires and a new one takes his place. Yet something is wrong -- the rituals have been upset and nothing is going the way it should. Roddy needs help, and certain powers indicate that Nick is to be the one to help her. And Nick is cool about helping her -- in theory! but it's a bit worrying that she seems to mistake him for a magic-user. Their stories unfold, side-by-side, each part leading into the next, and the Merlin Conspiracy thickens as the tales swirl around each other -- twining, meeting and affecting each other, yet never completely combining until the very end chapters when all is finally revealed. Compelling, howlingly funny in places, mind-boggling -- this is going to WOW DWJ fans all around the world (and probably in other universes too).""]",The Merlin Conspiracy,Visit Amazon's Diana Wynne Jones Page,"1,750,255 in Books (",$28.56,0007151403

"['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Contemporary']","[""Starred Review. Two murders committed 400 years apart form the core of British author Mills's outstanding second novel (after <I>Amagansett</I>, which won a CWA Dagger Award). In 1958, Cambridge undergraduate Adam Strickland, who's studying a curious Tuscan Renaissance garden for his art history thesis, is equally intrigued by both the garden of the Villa Docci estate and its elderly owner, Signora Francesca Docci. Built by the villa's first owner, Federico Docci, in 1577, the garden was intended as a memorial to his wife, Flora, who died when she was only 25. In the course of his research, Adam begins to sense that events, both past and present, are not as clear-cut as they appear. In particular, he discovers that there are several versions of the death of Signora Docci's oldest son, Emilio, who was shot by the villa's German occupiers at the end of WWII. Adam is hailed by all when he comes up with a novel theory explaining Flora's death in 1548, but when he begins to speculate on Emilio's demise, he finds himself in serious danger.

This one, though still set in the post-World War II era, takes place in Tuscany, where Adam Banting, a Cambridge architecture student, is doing research on a famous Renaissance garden. But as he digs into the history and iconography of the garden, he comes to believe that the seemingly tranquil bower offers a road map to how its original owner murdered his wife. Similarly, as Adam learns more about the family who now owns the garden, he follows the trail of a more contemporary murder. This sort of jumping between historical and contemporary crimes has become commonplace, even cliched, in highbrow literary thrillers, but Mills uses the technique effectively, generating tension on both fronts and introducing some dizzying plot machinations. Adam is a bit too callow to hold our attention the way the robust Basque did in <i>Amagansett,</i> but there is plenty here to captivate those who like high culture mixed with high crime (fans of Iain Pears, for example). <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association.

In Road it\'s: never pass a part of the world with your name in or on it. Thus this genealogist-cum-pint-swilling adventurer embarks on a frolicsome, drunken globe-trot to uncover the roots of all things McCarthy and in the process expose what it means to be a McCarthy and, by extension, to be Irish. It\'s a lively, lusty quest; McCarthy travels like a Renaissance explorer with a film director\'s lens. In Tangiers, he finds a Moroccan McCarthy who puts a unique spin on the term ""black Irish."" He takes in America\'s premier Irish event, New York\'s St. Patrick\'s Day Parade (which he finds more Celtic and American than Irish and not a little Scottish besides). Next stop: Tasmania, the penal colony where so many Irish were sent by the British government. And how could he resist a visit to the town of McCarthy, Alaska, population 18? The ultimate mocking tour guide with acerbic charm, McCarthy delivers scathing critiques of people and places, himself included. His droll and often drunken existentialist view proffers a unique (and distinctly Irish) perspective on the world that is part history, part McCarthy\'s Law. Some may be put off by his frequent references to drugs, sex and overimbibing, but McCarthy is like a character out of contemporary Irish literature, a traveler on a winding road surrounded by life\'s imperfections yet finding them beautiful despite it all (especially after a pint or two).

As his readers well know, McCarthy will go anywhere and everywhere as long as a pint (or two) in a cozy pub awaits at journey's end. He risks life and limb, such as when he faces, with utmost courage, a rabid crowd of drunken Scots Catholic soccer fans, come from Glasgow to celebrate Paddy's Day in Manhattan. Betimes he stays closer to home, at an Ireland versus England rugby match in Dublin, for instance, but really, how can he resist visiting Tasmania, Montserrat, Butte (Montana), and a tiny (population 18) Alaskan town that somehow bears his name?

"['Books', 'Biographies & Memoirs', 'Historical']","['In this lively chronicle, historian Francis (<I>Transcendental Utopias</I>) offers a compelling portrait of the decline of Puritan ways in the late 17th century and the ascent of a secular spirit in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Although devout, Samuel Sewall (1652&ndash;1730) turned away from an early religious vocation to pursue a career in public office and married into the colony\'s aristocracy. He found himself catapulted into the limelight as one of nine judges who condemned the alleged witches of Salem in 1692. Francis calls this the turning point in Sewall\'s life and work. Never convinced that the condemned women were guilty, Sewall felt remorse; in 1697 he walked into a Boston church and offered a public apology, the only one of the three judges to do so. As a result, he was rebuffed by his social circle. Yet, according to Francis, Sewall\'s courage is magnified by his taking a stand he knew would result in ostracism. In his later years, Sewall wrote tracts opposing the colonists\' treatment of Indians and slaves. Francis beautifully captures not only Sewall\'s personality and significance but also the shifting times in which he lived, when it was becoming no longer possible to ""see the world as a simple allegorical struggle between... good and evil.""

All rights reserved.', ""Disquiet about the propriety of the Salem witch trials of 1692 existed even when they were under way, and the affair was quickly terminated when accusations of devilry began to nick the Puritan elite. One of the doubters was Samuel Sewall (1652-1730), a member of the court and a diligent diary keeper. Biographer Francis exploits this primary document to present Sewall as a figure imbued with the Calvinist mentality of the Puritans who shed some of its strictures, at least concerning law; theologically, Sewall remained true. More to the point of reading interest, Francis finds through the diary a genial but psychologically complicated figure who recorded the panoply of daily occurrences, such as his business and legal affairs, harmony and strife in his family, and, after the death of his wife, his courting of widows. Sewall was a remarkable witness to colonial life, but it is his repudiation of his role in the witch trials that centrally engages the author's curiosity. Evocatively detailed and clearly written, Francis' biography will be crucial for students of Salem. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association.

Punitive towards office politics, he revolutionised the company from within, altering an entire corporate culture, divesting billions of dollars in unneeded assets and transforming IBM from a fractured, process-driven business into a nimble, customer-driven enterprise able to respond quickly to the volatile technology market and face down Microsoft and Intel in the internet era.

"['Books', 'Literature & Fiction']","[""BOOKER SHORTLISTED 2008. An epic chronicle of the last 20 years of British life from the Booker shortlisted and Granta Best of Young British novelist, Philip Hensher. Beginning in 1974 and ending with the fading of Thatcher's government in 1996, 'The Northern Clemency' is Philip Hensher's epic portrait of an entire era, a novel concerned with the lives of ordinary people and history on the move. Set in Sheffield, it charts the relationship between two families: Malcolm and Katherine Glover and their three children; and their neighbours the Sellers family, newly arrived from London so that Bernie can pursue his job with the Electricity Board. The day the Sellers move in there is a crisis across the road: Malcolm Glover has left home, convinced his wife is having an affair. The consequences of this rupture will spread throughout the lives of both couples and their children, in particular 10-year-old Tim Glover, who never quite recovers from a moment of his mother's public cruelty and the amused taunting of 15-year-old Sandra Sellers, childhood crises that will come to a head twenty years later. In the background, England is changing: from a manufacturing and industrial based economy into a new world of shops, restaurants and service industries, a shift particularly marked in the North with the miners' strike of 1984, which has a dramatic impact on both families. Inspired by the expansive scale and webs of relationships of the great nineteenth-century Russian novels, 'The Northern Clemency' shows Philip Hensher to be one of our greatest chroniclers of English life.""]",The Northern Clemency,Visit Amazon's Philip Hensher Page,"6,909,873 in Books (",$29.50,0007174799

In 1941, the war appears to be going badly on many fronts. Churchill is the confirmed leader and so his domestic political struggles are slightly lessened, but battered, bloody and almost bankrupt, Britain limps on. Churchill knows his country cannot win the war alone. An alliance with America is paramount, and Churchill is determined to develop and use a friendship with Averall Harriman, American Ambassador to Britain, and personal friend of President Franklin Roosevelt. But his son's wife exploits this first. Pamela Churchill's passionate affair, conducted under her father-in-law's roof, presents Churchill with the appalling dilemma between saving his country, and allowing his son Randolph to be cuckolded. With no British battlefield successes, and with a jubilant Germany controlling Europe, 1941 was a bleak year. America continued resolute against fighting, but by the year's close Pearl Harbour had forced America into the war. Why had the Japanese been persuaded to attack American targets? And how were the rumours of the attack prevented from reaching American ears? Decisions of love and war are often matters of perception. And so it was in this case.

After a vexing 30-year leap, Myrtis\'s creepy, emotionally ill daughter, Edythe, takes over the narrative, kidnapping one of the Ya-Yas\' grandchildren.

Did Flashman's adventures in the Duchy of Strackenz provide the inspiration for The Prisoner of Zenda? The similarities are certainly there as Flash Harry becomes embroiled in a desperate succession of escapes, disguises, amours and (when unavoidable) hand-to-hand combats in an epic adventure that takes him from the gaming-halls of London to the dungeons and throne-rooms of Europe. And for once Flashman's talents for deceit and treachery are matched by those of Otto von Bismarck and the beautiful but deadly Lola Montez.""]",Royal Flash (Flashman Papers),Visit Amazon's George MacDonald Fraser Page,"5,582,703 in Books (",$79.94,0007210965

"['Books', 'Literature & Fiction', 'Genre Fiction']","['Starred Review. Author of the bestselling Emperor series on the life of Julius Caesar, Iggulden turns to another of history\'s great conquerors, Genghis Khan, for a new series of brilliantly imagined and addictive historical fiction. Future conqueror Temujin&mdash;""a man of iron""&mdash;is born to the khan (ruler) of a fierce Mongol tribe that roams central Asia\'s steppes in the 12th century. When his father is killed by Tartar raiders before Temujin reaches manhood, a rival claims the tribe and banishes Temujin\'s family. Left behind without resources when the tribe migrates, the family struggles to survive the harsh environment, and Temujin dreams of gathering similar outcasts&mdash;wanderers and herdsmen&mdash;into a new tribe. After assembling a core of these ""men scorned by all the others,"" Temujin begins raiding Tartar camps. As his fame spreads, Temujin launches an ambitious campaign to unite the Mongol tribes ""after a thousand years of warfare"" into a single people, defeat the Tartars and invade China. Building on the fragments of Genghis\'s life, Iggulden weaves a spellbinding story of an exotic and ""unforgiving land"" and the enigmatic young man&mdash;charismatic, a brilliant tactician and capable ""of utter ruthlessness""&mdash;who sets out to tame it.

Just as he did for Julius Caesar, Iggulden plants his subject firmly into historical context, fictionalizing the early years of Temujin, the son of a khan brutally murdered by invading Tartars. When his family is betrayed by a rival and abandoned by their clan, young Temujin vows revenge and dreams of the day he will become the conqueror rather than the conquered. Surviving the harsh reality of the Asian steppes, his adolescence is informed by a sense of mission that grows more urgent with each passing year. As a young man, he begins to develop skills as both a fierce warrior and a diplomat, reuniting Mongol tribes and factions into a formidable army. This authentically detailed historical drama sets the stage for the next installment. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright &#169; American Library Association.
